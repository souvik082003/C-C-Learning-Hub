🛠️ Get Set Up & Ready to Launch!
Time to get this beast running on your local machine. Follow these simple steps.

1. The Essentials
First, make sure you have Node.js installed. It's the fuel for our backend server. Open your terminal and type:

node -v

If you see a version number (like v20.11.0), you're a champion! If not, grab it from the official Node.js website.

2. Power Up the Backend
Let's get the server engine roaring.

Jump into the backend directory:

cd backend

Install the power-ups:

npm install

This command summons express, cors, and axios to our cause.

3. Unleash the API Power!
Our code execution is handled by the legendary Judge0 API. You need a secret key to unlock its power.

Head over to the Judge0 CE API page on RapidAPI.

Hit "Subscribe to Test" and grab the free Basic plan.

On the "Endpoints" tab, you'll find your secret X-RapidAPI-Key in the code examples. Copy it!

Open backend/server.js and paste your key where it says 'YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY'.


// Inside backend/server.js
const JUDGE0_API_KEY = process.env.JUDGE0_API_KEY || 'PASTE_YOUR_AWESOME_KEY_HERE'; 


🚀 Let's Go! How to Run the Project
Ignite the Server:

In your terminal, make sure you're inside the backend folder.

Unleash the server with this command:

node server.js

You'll see Server is running on http://localhost:3000. Don't close this terminal!

Launch the Website:

Go to the frontend folder.

Double-click index.html. It will open right in your browser.

You are now ready to start your coding adventure. Go build something amazing!

Happy Coding! Let the learning begin! 🎉
